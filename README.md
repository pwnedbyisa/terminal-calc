## terminal calculator (WIP)

### Running It
- git clone
- cd into the directory
- python3 calcadv.py

### Functions
 - basically a command line calulator with some advanced functions (ex// inverse trig) and a lil personality
 - stores memory, has customized output, it's pretty, that's about it

### Currently Working On
 - usability (readability)
 - graphing (there's currently no tick marks... or axes... or origin)

### Later additions
 - probably language conversion

### Misc
 - please keep in mind this is a learning projects for me
 - as in i'm still learning how to code and that's pretty obvious (imo)
 - yeah ik my code can be optimized like a lot js close your eyes idk
